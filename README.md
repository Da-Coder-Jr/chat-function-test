# ðŸ’¬ Chat

A GitHub Actions workflow that enables chat conversations with AI models directly in GitHub Issues. This workflow uses GitHub's AI models API to provide intelligent responses to your questions and discussions.

- Create a new issue
    - Open a new issue in this repository
    - Write your question or message in the issue title
    - The workflow will automatically respond using the default model (GPT-4.1)

- Change the AI model
    - Add a label with the model ID you want to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o)
    - The next response will use the selected model
    - Available models are listed as labels in the repository
